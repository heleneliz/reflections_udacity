When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate?
To show off?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Many commits..
Don't want to 'officilaise' changes before being ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: strict independant copy that is linked to the mother
clone: strict independant copy that is not linked to the mother
branch: strict independant copy that can be accessed from the mother
Forks: when you want to work by yourself.
Clone: when you want to steal someone else's work.
Branch: when you collaborate with someone.

Reflections on Lessons 1
How would easy access to history of files make me a more efficient programmer?
- saving mistakes
- saving older versions that work
- show progress

When do you want your code to be saved?
- regular intervals: pb is that it isn't logic.
 
Commits - one commit per logical change

Drawbacks of saving by yourself:
- you might forget
- what you think is logic now might not be logic later

TRACHING ACROSS FILES
- manual commit are not logic so there is no point to save files logically

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Find commits with git log and highlight the differences with git diff

How can you become more confident to make changes that could break something
- I know I can always revert back

What happens if you initialize a repository?

Staging area is a limbo of the repository - it waits there until you're sure you have made all the changes you wanted.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Never have more than one file in the staging area at once
Never add file when you've made logical change
